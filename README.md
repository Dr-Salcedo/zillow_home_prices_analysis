**Assumptions:**

You are an investor with a minimum of $100,000 to deploy upfront.
Your time horizon for investment is 5-10 years (this is not a liquid investment).
You seek to maximize growth potential by tapping into home value appreciation in one of America's fastest growing metro areas.
Your threshold for volatility is low (note that no investment is guaranteed and any investment with Hold the Gold is subject to future market conditions).

**Methodology:**

Using Zillow housing data, we filtered out all home price data not from the D.C. metro area.
Our dataset included past home sales in D.C. from 1996-2018.
We sorted the price data by zipcodes (n=18).
